# carbon

Carbon is a modular content mod that aims to offer smaller, "bite-sized" content additions that stand independently of one another. These additions are meant to be configurable, allowing players to pick and choose what parts of the mod are actually added to the game. "Modules" may or may not interact with one another. TBD.
